## 🚀 Features

* Polynomial interpolation
* Least-squares regression
* Error evaluation using **MAE** and **MSE**
* Visual plots for comparison
* Numerical analysis with Python and Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧮 Methods Implemented

### **Polynomial Approximation**

* Lagrange interpolation
* Polynomial fitting using Vandermonde matrices
* Least-squares approximate polynomials

### **Error Metrics**

* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)** – average absolute deviation
* **MSE (Mean Squared Error)** – penalizes larger deviations

These metrics help compare the stability and accuracy of the methods.

---

## 📈 Visualizations

The notebook includes plots illustrating:

* Raw data vs. fitted polynomials
* Approximation curves for multiple degrees
* Error distributions across methods

This supports clear, visual performance evaluation.

---

## 🧠 Results & Conclusions

* Higher-degree polynomials do not always yield better accuracy.
* Least-squares fitting provides stable performance on noisy or imperfect data.
* Error metrics reveal the most balanced polynomial fit for the dataset.
* Visualization confirms quantitative conclusions.
